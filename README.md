A C Program to implement A* Search Algorithm 
This Program is Optimze the Size of Memory
It uses:
    - 4058 bytes of program storage space (Code Size)
    - 1058 bytes of dynamic memory (Global variables Size)
The Code is Written to be run on Microcontroller that's why I develop it using bits to get the optimal variables size
ALL THE INITIALIZED BITS HAS BEEN USED
OPTIMIZED FOR 15 * 15 GRID MAPS
Tested on Arduino UNO:
    It takes 1.83 second to find the goal (AT WAREST CASE)
    If the goal is blocked, It takes 2.57 seoncds (AT WAREST CASE)
The Algorithm Written on one C file to easily move it to any Microcontroller
